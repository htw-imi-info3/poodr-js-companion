/*
 * NOTE: This example is a bit dense to translate because it is exploring code
 * taken directly from a piece of Ruby on Rails. I've chosen not to try
 * recreating it here.
 *
 * The example aims to show that sometimes checking for an object's
 * class/type or the messages it responds to can be a useful technique, and that
 * it does not necessitate replacement with a duck type.
 *
 * The code specifically demonstrates checking for stable, core language
 * classes, where using a duck type would require changing these classes:
 * possible, but risky.
 *
 * Best to just go look at the actual Ruby example -- preferably with the full 
 * context of the book.
